This course provides an introduction to computational statistics. 
The aim of the course is to build simple and accessible yet strong mathematical foundations in probability theory, descriptive statistics, 
and hypothesis testing while learning how to interpret and analyze data with clarity and confidence.

In each chapter, we will navigate together through practical exercises that connect theory to real-world applications, using Python and R with real datasets. 
No prior mathematical or programming experience is required to attend this course.
Everyone is welcome!
