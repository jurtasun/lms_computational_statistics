Introduction to computational statistics

Roadmap of the course:

Chapter 1. Descriptive statistics.

— The idea of population and sampling.
— Describe central tendency and variation.
— Data visualization: histogram, box, violin, dispersion.

Chapter 2. Predictive probability.

— Definition of probability and random events.
— Discrete events: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson distributions.
— Continuous events: Uniform, Exponential, Gaussian distributions.
— Mean and variance as expected values.

Chapter 3. Parameter estimation.

— Prediction vs inference. Variables, parameters and estimators.
— The Law of Large Numbers (LLN).
— The Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
— Compute expected values confidence intervals.

Chapter 4. Hypothesis testing and Bayesian probability.

— General approach to hypothesis testing.
— Common examples of statistical tests (t-test, Fisher exact, ANOVA, χ2).
— Parametric vs non-parametric tests.
— Revisiting P-values: errors, power, and Bayesian probability.
