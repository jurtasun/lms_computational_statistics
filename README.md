This course provides an introduction to probability and statistic inference.
The topics covered will include basic concepts on probability theory, descriptive statistics, inference, and hypothesis testing. 
The aim of the course is to provide strong foundations at the mathematical and theoretical level, while providing practical exercises to work on real data.

The course is organized in five chapters, covering the topics listed below. 
All will be followed by a practical session and hands-on coding, both in `Python` and `R`. 
No prior mathematical or programming experience is required for the attendance of this course.

## Roadmap of the course

### Chapter 1. Descriptive statistics.

- The idea of population and sampling.
- Describe central tendency and variation.
- Data visualization: histogram, box, violin, dispresion.

### Chapter 2. Predictive probability.

- Definition of probability and random events.
- Discrete and continous probability distributions.
- Mean and variance as expected values.

### Chapter 3. Parameter estimation.

- Variables, parameters and estimators.
- The Law of Large Numbers (LLN).
- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

### Chapter 4. Hypothesis testing.

- Prediction vs inference.
- Hypothesis, statistic tests, significance and p-values.
- Common examples of statistic tests (t-test, Fisher, &chi;<sup>2</sup>)

### Chapter 5. Bayesian probability.

- The problem of conditional probability.
- The frequentist and Bayesian definitions.
- The Bayes rule and applications.
