[LMS Introduction to probability, statistics and hypothesis testing](https://github.com/jurtasun/lms_intro_probability_statistics)

This course provides an introduction to the fields of probability, statistics and hypothesis testing.
The topics covered will include basic concepts on probability theory, descriptive statistics, prediction, inference, and hypothesis testing. 
The aim of the course is to provide simple and accessible, yet strong mathematical foundations, while providing practical exercises to work on real data.

All will be followed by a practical session and hands-on coding, both in `Python` and `R`. Examples from RNA-seq, Variant Calling, and Methylation data.

No prior mathematical or programming experience is required to attend this course.
The course is organized in four chapters, covering the topics listed below. 

## Roadmap of the course

### Chapter 1. Descriptive statistics.

- The idea of population and sampling.
- Describe central tendency and variation.
- Data visualization: histogram, box, violin, dispersion.

### Chapter 2. Predictive probability.

- Definition of probability and random events.
- Discrete (Binomial, Poisson) and continuous (Gaussian) probability distributions.
- Examples of RNA-seq, Variant Calling, and Methylation data.

### Chapter 3. Parameter estimation.

- Prediction vs inference. Variables, parameters and estimators.
- The Law of Large Numbers (LLN).
- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
- Computing expected values confidence intervals.

### Chapter 4. Hypothesis testing.

- Formulating hypothesis. General approach to hypothesis testing.
- Common examples of statistic tests (t-test, Fisher exact and ANOVA, &chi;<sup>2</sup>).
- Parametric vs non-parametric tests.
- Revisiting P-values: errors, power, and Bayesian probability.
