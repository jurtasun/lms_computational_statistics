This course provides an introduction to the fields of probability, statistics and hypothesis testing.
The topics covered will include basic concepts on probability theory, descriptive statistics, prediction, inference, and hypothesis testing. 
The aim of the course is to provide simple and accessible, yet strong mathematical foundations, while providing practical exercises to work on real data.

All will be followed by a practical session and hands-on coding, both in `Python` and `R`. Examples from RNA-seq, Variant Calling, and Methylation data.

No prior mathematical or programming experience is required to attend this course.
The course is organized in four chapters, covering the topics listed below. 

## Roadmap of the course

### Chapter 1. Descriptive statistics.

- The idea of population and sampling.
- Describe central tendency and variation.
- Data visualization: histogram, box, violin, dispresion.

### Chapter 2. Predictive probability.

- Definition of probability and random events.
- Discrete and continous probability distributions.
- Examples of RNA-seq, Variant Calling, and Methylation data.

### Chapter 3. Parameter estimation.

- Variables, parameters and estimators.
- The Law of Large Numbers (LLN).
- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
- Computing expected values.

### Chapter 4. Hypothesis testing.

- Prediction vs inference.
- Hypothesis, statistic tests, significance and p-values.
- Common examples of statistic tests (t-test, Fisher, &chi;<sup>2</sup>)

### Chapter 5. Bayesian probability.

- The problem of conditional probability.
- The frequentist and Bayesian definitions.
- The Bayes rule and applications.
