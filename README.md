This course provides an introduction to computational statistics. 
The aim of the course is to build simple and accessible yet strong mathematical foundations in probability theory, descriptive statistics, 
and hypothesis testing while learning how to interpret and analyze data with clarity and confidence.

In each chapter, we will navigate together through practical exercises that connect theory to real-world applications, using `Python` and `R` with real datasets. 

No prior mathematical or programming experience is required to attend this course.
The course is organized in four chapters, covering the topics listed below. 

## Roadmap of the course

### Chapter 1. Prediction and inference.

- General frameworks for statistics and probability.
- The idea of descriptive statistics, population and sampling.
- The idea of predictive probability and random events.
- Data visualization: histogram, box, violin, dispersion.

### Chapter 2. Foundations of probability.

- Definition of probability and random events.
- Discrete events: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson distributions.
- Continuous events: Uniform, Exponential, Gaussian distributions.
- Mean and variance as expected values.

### Chapter 3. Parameter estimation.

- Prediction vs inference. Variables, parameters and estimators.
- The Law of Large Numbers (LLN).
- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
- Compute expected values confidence intervals.

### Chapter 4. Hypothesis testing.

- General approach to hypothesis testing.
- Common examples of statistical tests (t-test, Fisher exact, ANOVA, &chi;<sup>2</sup>).
- Parametric vs non-parametric tests.
- Revisiting P-values: errors, power, and Bayesian probability.
